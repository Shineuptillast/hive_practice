Covid data is transferred from local machine to the Local file system of the virtual machine using file zilla.

Files are transferred to the hdfs file system.


Creating table from local file system

hdfs dfs -ls /user 

Making a new directory -->
hdfs fs -mkdir /user/hive_practice

Copying file into hdfs from local 

hdfs dfs -put /home/cloudera/Desktop/covid_data.csv /user/hive_practice

now entering hive cli

hive

create database hive_practice;

use hive_practice;

create table covid_data(
dob date,
country string,
total_confirmed int,
total_deaths int,
total_recovered int,
total_active int,
new_cases int,
new_deaths int,
new_recovered int,
who_region string
)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ',';

describe formatted covid_data;

creating an internal table and loading data from hdfs

create table covid_data_hdfs(
date_of_case date,
country string,
total_cases int,
total_deaths int,
total_recovery int,
total_active int,
new_cases int,
new_deaths int,
new_recovery int,
who_region string)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by ',';

load data inpath '/user/hive_lab/' into table covid_data_hdfs;


creating an external table having data within the hdfs location

again copying the data into the hdfs location

hdfs dfs -put '/home/cloudera/Desktop/covid_data.csv /user/hive_lab/


DATA ANALYSIS

1)
TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES BY COUNTRY
SELECT COUNTRY, SUM(NEW_CASES) FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY COUNTRY;

2)
TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS BY COUNTRY 
SELECT COUNTRY , SUM(NEW_DEATHS) FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY COUNTRY

3)
TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS REGION WISE
SELECT WHO_REGION, SUM(NEW_DEATHS) FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY WHO_REGION;

4)
REGION HAVING THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF DEATHS
SELECT WHO_REGION, SUM(NEW_DEATHS) AS C_1 FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY WHO_REGION ORDER BY C_1;

5) 
REGION IMPACTED MAXIMUM BY THE COVID 
SELECT WHO_REGION, SUM(NEW_DEATHS) C_1 FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY WHO_REGION ORDER BY C_1 DESC LIMIT 1;

6)
REGION THAT HAS DEALT WITH COVID EFFICIENTLY
SELECT WHO_REGION, SUM(NEW_RECOVERY) C_1 FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY WHO_REGION ORDER BY C_1;

7)
COUNTRY THAT HAVE MOST RECOVERED PATIENTS
SELECT COUNTRY , SUM(NEW_RECOVERED) C_1 FROM COVID_DATA GROUP BY COUNTRY ORDER BY C_1 DESC LIMIT 1;
